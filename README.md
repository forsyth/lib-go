# lib-go
library of go packages that I can use in different applications

-- import "github.com/forsyth/lib-go/xyz"

It turns out that for most non-trivial packages it's better to have a single repo, or at most a repo with sub-modules for a group of related packages,
so this lib-go one will probably be abandoned.
